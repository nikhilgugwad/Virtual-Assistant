# Virtual Assistant in Python

Welcome to our Virtual Assistant project developed as part of the "Application Development using Python" course. This project aims to showcase how a virtual assistant can be built using Python to perform various tasks through text-based interactions.

## Project Overview

Our virtual assistant is designed to understand and respond to natural language commands. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with the user. The assistant can perform a range of tasks, including providing information, answering questions, and executing predefined commands.

## Note

This project focuses on text-based interaction and does not include a graphical user interface (GUI). The assistant responds to user commands through the terminal.

## Features

- Text-based interaction with the virtual assistant.
- Speech recognition for converting spoken language into text.
- Text-to-speech for providing audible responses.
- Perform tasks such as retrieving weather information, searching the web, and more.

## How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: The virtual assistant uses speech recognition to convert user's spoken commands into text.

2. **Natural Language Processing**: The text input is processed using natural language processing techniques to understand the user's intent.

3. **Task Execution**: Based on the user's command, the virtual assistant performs tasks like fetching data from APIs, searching the web, or providing informative responses.

4. **Text-to-Speech**: The response generated by the assistant is converted to speech using text-to-speech technology.
